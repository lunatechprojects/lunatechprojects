    <p>
The nitrates of all metals exist. They are obtained generally by neutralisation of dilute nitric acid by eithere their
corresponding base or carbonate.
Some metallic nitrates are obtained by direct reaction of the metal with concetrated nitric acid.<br>

	<b>Physical Properties</b><br>
1.Nitrates are all crystalline salts an only those of sodium and potassium are not hydrated.
2.All nitrates are soluble in water.<br>

	<b>Chemical Properties</b><br>
1. Nitrates are all decomposed by heat.The lower the metal is in the reactivity series the more easily is it decomposed.
   sodium and potassium nitrates melt and evolve oxygen. The residue is the corresponding nitrite.<br>
		<b>2NaNO<sub>3</sub>(s) &rarr; NaNO<sub>2</sub>(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)</b><br>
   
   Almost all other nitrates give off both oxygen and nitogen dioxide and leave the metal oxide as residue<br>
	<b>2Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(s) &rarr; 2CaO(s) + 4NO<sub>2</sub>(s) +O<sub>2</sub>(g)</b><br>
   silver and mercury decompose to give the corresponding metal, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen.<br>
	<b>2AgNO<sub>3</sub>(s) &rarr; 2Ag(s) + 2NO<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)</b><br>
   Ammonium nitrate decomposes to give dinitrogen oxide and steam. If heating is continued, the last few drops
   of molten ammonium nitrate explode.<br>
2. The reaction between the solutions of a nitrate and iron (II) sulphate is known as the brown ring test and
   it is a characteristic test for recognisisng soluble nitrates. As the concetrated  sulphuric acid is added, it settles 
   below the iron (II) sulphate an at their junction, a brown ring <b>(FeSO<sub>4</sub>.NO)</b> develops.<br>
3. When heated with sodium or lead nitrate, or with any other nitrate, the more stable concetrated sulphuric acid
   displaces the more volatile nitric acid<br>
</p>

		<h3>Some Important nitrates and their uses</h3>
<p>
1.Sodium nitrate occurs naturally in large quantities in rock known as caliche which is found in Chile hemce its name is Chile saltpetre.
  It was the earliest source of nitrogenous fertiliser applied to soil by man and it is still being used as ssuch. The substance is
  also extensively used in making other chemicals such as nitric acid and potassium nitrtate.<br>
2. Potassium nitrate is used in the manufacture of gun powder, Gun powder is a mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulphur. When ignited 
   it burns and explodes.<br>
3. Ammoium nitrate is useful in the prepation of explosives. It is an important fertiliser.
</p>
	<h3>The Nitrogen cycle</h3>
<p>
Nitrogen is essential to plants and animals for the production of proteins, Plants cannot, however absorb nitogen directly
but only in the form of nitrates. There are a number of ways in which the nitogen in air is made available to soil as the desired
nitrates<br>

<b>1. Natural methods of fixixing atmospheric nitrogen.</b><br>
	a)Certain bacteria living in colonies in the roots of leguminous plants have the ability to convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrates.<br>
	b)Some other bacteria which live in as free organisms in the soil are also able to fix atmospheric nitrogen.<br>
	c)Lightning can cause atmospheric nitrogen to combine with oxygen to form nitrogen oxide. This will in turn dissolve in rain water to form nitric acid.<br>
	  the nitric acid is then converted into nitrates in the soil.<br>
<b>2. Artificial methods of fixing atmospheric nitrogen</b><br>
	Because many farming lands contain inadequate amounts of nitogen in the soil, for reasons such as man's removal of plants for food, inadequate drainage and weathering
	, artificial means of restoring the nitrogen have to be used. This is usually done by adding fertilisers; either natural fertilisers, such as cow dung or farmyard manure,
	or artificial fertilisers, such as ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate. The ammonium fertilisers are manufactured from ammonia which has been made by the Haber process
	using hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen<br>
	When plants absorb the nitrates they are later are converted into proteins. Proteins are body building materials for both plants and animals.
<br><b>3. Action of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria</b><br>
	Certain bacteria in the soil are capable of breaking down urea and dead bodies of plants and animals and converting the protein into ammonia. Nitrifying bacteria oxidise
	this ammonia and convert it into nitrates.
	Other bacteria are able to oxidise the ammonia and convert it into nitrogen which is returned to atmosphere. These are the denitrifying bacteria.<br>
	The way in which elemental nitrogen continually circulates in nature is known as the nitrogen cycle
